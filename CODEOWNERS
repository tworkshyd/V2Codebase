# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @anand-tworks and @tworkshyd/V2CodeBase will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

*       @anand-tworks @tworkshyd/V2CodeBase

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies specific files, only @<username> and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.


# In this for example, @tworkshyd/V2CodeBase owns any files in the mcu1
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.


# Control Board Code base
/ControlBoard @tworkshyd/V2CodeBase 	@tworkshyd/V2CodeBase/ControlBoard


# Display Board Code base
/DisplayBoard @tworkshyd/V2CodeBase 	@tworkshyd/V2CodeBase/DisplayBoard


# Testcases and Docs
/tests @tworkshyd/V2CodeBase 			@tworkshyd/V2CodeBase/Tests

























# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
#docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
#apps/ @octocat

# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository.
/docs/ @doctocat
