MCP3201 (2.7V 12-Bit A/D Converter with SPI Serial Interface)
===============================================================
The Microchip Technology Inc. MCP3201 is a successive approximation 12-bit Analog-to-Digital (A/D) Converter with on-board 
sample and hold circuitry. The device provides a single pseudo-differential input. Differential Nonlinearity (DNL) is specified
at +/- 1 LSB, and Integral Nonlinearity (INL) is offered in +/- 1 LSB (MCP3201-B) and +/- 2 LSB (MCP3201-C) versions. Communication with
the device is done using a simple serial interface compatible with the SPI protocol. The device is capable of sample rates of 
up to 100 ksps at a clock rate of 1.6 MHz. The MCP3201 operates over a broad voltage range (2.7V - 5.5V). Low current design 
permits operation with typical standby and active currents of only 500 nA and 300 uA, respectively.The device is offered in 
8-pin MSOP, PDIP,TSSOP and 150 mil SOIC packages.
